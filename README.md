# 🌿 Traffic Safety System 🌿

A simple but meaningful project where I built a system to measure vehicle speed using Arduino sensors. When a vehicle goes too fast, the system gently raises an alert to keep the roads safer. To better understand and improve the system, I also used 3D simulation to see how it all works in real life.

## ✨ What it Does  
- Measures vehicle speed with signal stations and sensors  
- Triggers alerts if the speed limit is exceeded  
- Uses 3D simulation for testing and fine-tuning detection  

## 🛠️ Tools and Tech  
- C & Python programming  
- Arduino Uno microcontroller  
- Various sensors for speed detection  
- 3D simulation software for system modeling
